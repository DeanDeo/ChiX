# [Chi X](https://rsdesoto.github.io/ChiX/index.html)

This is an app to fetch, from a search, nearby attractions, the nearest CTA train stop with incoming arrival times, and weather information for the city of Chicago.

Nearby attractions are displayed on a map with their locations marked. The attractions are also listed with links for directions (Google) and additional information (FOURSQUARE).

The current weather is displayed as well as the forecast every three hours for the next five days.
